### THIS REPOSITORY IS IN BUILD! ITS NOT FINISHED YET!

### Overview

Your new to coding Discord.py Bots and want use some code `examples` to start? Well, i've got a solution for you. In this repository, i've coded some bots, which have diffrent features, you can use `4 free`! These are *self-hosted bots* – meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance. 

### Bots

- **Warnings** (keep your server safe from unwanted spam, raids, and attacks with Atlas's anti-raid feature. With customizable settings, you can configure Atlas to detect and block unwanted behavior before it becomes a problem.)

- **Global Chat** (connect with other Discord servers and communities with a global chat bot. By using, global chat can connect your users can communicate with members of other servers that also have your bot set up.)

- **Ban**/**Kick**/**Mute** (keep your server free of trolls, spammers, and troublemakers with this bot.)

- **Moderation** (manage your server with ease using this bots moderation tools. With features like warning, muting, and role management, this bot gives you the power to keep your server running smoothly and harmoniously.)

### Getting Started

These are `self-hosted` bots – meaning you will need to host and maintain your `own instances`.

The Installation is very easy, and you do **NOT NEED** to know anything about coding! The Bots can be controlled inside of Discord.
For more information on how to use the bots, check out the [`installation-guide`](https://github.com/liinuu/discordpy-bots/blob/main/installation.md).
